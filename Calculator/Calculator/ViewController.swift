// In our UI, we can also group items together by "Stacks" (technically, embed
// them in Stacks). By doing so, it grants us greater control over how these items
// will appear in different layouts and rotations.

    // We set the display up as an "Outlet" Connection, which gives us a
    // pointer, with which to refer to the component. Really, this turns the
    // component into an instance variable in our "ViewController" class.
    // Again, type here is referring to the component; i.e. UILabel.
    // Additionally, we will talk about weak / strong storage in a later session
    
    // Normally, UILabel (and any other component, really) will be inserted with a
    // "?", but we can change this to "!" if we **KNOW** that it will always be "set"

    // While we *could* classify a type, 'false' is a Bool by default, and Swift can detect this

    // it is automatically initialized to 'nil' as an Optional.

    // We set this up as an "Action" Connection, which allows us to receive
    // data from the component (a digit button in this case). For an action,

    // component type: "UIButton" in this case)

            // In the set case, it can have an associated value (a side value)
            // When we create the Optional, we can specify what type that value is
            // The "!" at the end grabs the associated value (in the set state)
        // If the Optional is in the "not set" state, the "!" will crash the app
        // This is good for debugging to highlight any errors

            // Note that we cannot use the displayValue computed property here (not without
            // some modification of the computation itself). This is because we are expecting
            // a Double in the set method of displayValue. While we could change the code below
            // to create a Double, this creates some unintended consequences, since we would then
            // stringify the Double each time we set it, automatically adding a ".0" if there is

    // calculates values on the fly. We can compute a "set" and "get" case
    
    // By doing this, we can have a variable that essentially automates what we do
    // when we set or get it, meaning we can unpack / transform values before assigning
    // to the variable, and can have variables mapped to specific values when we "get" them

            // (in this case, Double) and will point to the righthand side of whatever
